# Introduction

ChatCoin.app is an AI chat application powered by $CHAT, similar to Character.ai, but with the added benefit of earning token.&#x20;

In ChatCoin, each character has a unique personality and capability. **You can chat with well-known virtual companions, anime girls, celebrities, influencers, PFP NFTs (like CryptoPunk, BAYC, Azuki, Penguins) , and others you can imagine.**&#x20;

**In the meantime, you can also earn $CHAT by chatting with these characters.**

## Chat-to-Earn

The Chat-to-Earn feature allows you to earn rewards when you keep chatting with your AI agent, such as training languages, asking AI for thoughts and suggestions, interacting with AI to pass time, and having AI assist you with some tasks, etc.

**The more you chat, the better it understands you, the more rewards you earn.**

We'll launch a token as rewards, used to unlock more fun, like different styles of pre-defined AI personalities, staking, buying decentralized computing and storages, and other resources from our partners.

## UGC: User-Generated Characters

All users are able to create their own customizable characters, and issue [character tokens](character-token-ctoken.md) for them.&#x20;

Imagine **friend.tech** tailored for AI characters: the more popular your characters, the more valuable they become. We are creating innovative social networks that integrate effortlessly with AI.

## AI + Meme: Character Token

Today, many AI character apps offer fun features, but few combine the enjoyment of AI characters with community and value. As the anime fanbase grows and interactions with virtual characters become more varied, people are more likely to feel a strong connection with those characters.

[**Character Token**](character-token-ctoken.md) **(aka CToken)** is a native fungible token on the blockchain. **It's a meme token of an AI character, which represents the financial value of a certain AI character.** Every creator can launch a character token for each of their AI characters.

## Supported Platform

PC, Mobile (IOS\&Android) and Telegram Mini Apps.
