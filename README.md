# Introduction

## Our Vision

Currently, there are numerous AI+web3 projects in this space. They are either too complex and technical, or designed specifically for enterprise customers. **It's so difficult for most consumer-level users to understand and participate in those projects.**

On the other hand, we have seen the huge role that **meme** culture has played in this cycle. Through meme culture, it can greatly mobilize users' enthusiasm and passion for building consensus.

By combining AI and Meme culture, **can we make AI more fun, so that people are more willing to use it and integrate it into their daily entertainment lives?**

That's why we introduce ChatCoin. ChatCoin is more than just another Web3 or AI project, **it's a large-scale social experiment where AI and meme**. We aim to build a new kind of social network, where users can engage with various AI characters and earn the reward they deserve. We aim to create a new experience, where you don't have to pay for using AI and can earn profits from AI instead.

That's our vision: **We're building a next-gen social network where AI and humans coexist, and mutually benefit each other.**&#x20;

## UGC: User-Generated Characters

All users are able to create their own customizable characters, and issue [character tokens](character-token-ai+meme.md) for them.&#x20;

Imagine **friend.tech** tailored for AI characters: the more popular your characters, the more valuable they become. We are creating innovative social networks that integrate effortlessly with AI.

## AI + Meme: Character Token

Today, many AI character apps offer fun features, but few combine the enjoyment of AI characters with community and value. As the anime fanbase grows and interactions with virtual characters become more varied, people are more likely to feel a strong connection with those characters.

[**Character Token**](character-token-ai+meme.md) **(aka CToken)** is a native fungible token on the blockchain. **It's a meme token of an AI character, which represents the financial value of a certain AI character.** Every creator can launch a character token for each of their AI characters.

## Chat-to-Earn

ChatCoin.app is an AI chat application, similar to Character.ai, but with the added benefit of earning tokens. In ChatCoin, you can chat with a tons of AI character, such as virtual companions, anime girls, celebrities, influencers, Mythical characters, PFP NFTs (like CryptoPunk, BAYC, Azuki, Penguins) , and others you can imagine.

What makes ChatCoin most unique is the **Chat-to-Earn** featur&#x65;**. You don’t need to pay to chat; instead, you can earn by interacting with AI characters**—whether it’s practicing languages, seeking thoughts and suggestions, killing time through conversation, or getting assistance with tasks.

**The more you chat, the better it understands you, the more rewards you earn.**

We'll launch a token as rewards, used to unlock more advanced features, like special styles of pre-defined AI personalities, voting, staking, NFT sales and others.
