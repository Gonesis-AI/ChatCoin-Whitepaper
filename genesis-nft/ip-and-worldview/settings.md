## **Theme Story**

_Traveler, the one who embarks on a journey._

_The world is full of such travelers, each with their own reason to journey: for a bet, for pilgrimage, to find a lost love, to discover themselves. Some simply seek the thrill of a splendid adventure._

_Journeys, whether long or short, are never a smooth sail._

_To aid the lost, a legendary traveler founded "Gonesis", an organization named after himself, aiding travelers worldwide._

_Without form, "Gonesis" extends help through a tiny ring._

\
\
&#xNAN;_&#x46;or those eager to embark on their journey, "Gonesis" brings the ring to their side. It will guide travelers' paths, chronicle their experiences, and accompany their journey._

_Over time, the Gonesis Ring becomes a traveler's emblem._



_Destinations may entice, yet the true wealth lies in the journey itself._

_The Gonesis Ring captures every splendid facet of one's travels. Mementos, experiences, images, phrases â€“ each becomes a treasure, preserved within the ring's 'Journey Museum'._

_In "Gonesis", every traveler is also a collector, with their unique saga etched in time._



_Lost traveler, when you find yourself deeply trapped, please seek help through the ring._&#x20;

_The other members of "Gonesis" will receive your confusion, respond to your difficulties, and pave the way for you._

_Though travelers in the world rush through their own stories, the paths of each person intersect via this ring, mutually supporting each other to complete the long journey._

_When a traveler reaches journey's end, their legend is also preserved in the halls of the Gonesis Ring, serving as a landmark for subsequent travelers, urging them to advance more firmly towards their dreams._
